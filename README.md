<h3>EPL Transfers (1992 - 2022) EDA</h3>
<em>Exploratory Data analysis on football transfers in the English Premier League from 1992 to 2022</em>
 
<h4>Introduction</h4>


In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing player transfers of the English Premier League from 1992 to 2022. The dataset was pulled from github at https://github.com/ewenme/transfers and can also be found on Kaggle.

<h4>Objectives</h4>

1. To uncover hidden patterns.
2. To get insights into the transfer market in English football and how it has evolved over time.
3. To ascertain the kind of players that are sought after by clubs.

<h4>Findings and Insights</h4>

1. Of the clubs most involved in the most transfers in terms of quantity of buys and sales, only West Ham aren't part of the traditional PL's 'Big Six'. They rank fourth in terms of transfer involvements. They also bought and sold more players than Liverpool, Man Utd and Arsenal.

2. Arsenal's somewhat unpopular prudence in terms of spending is proven here as they rank tenth in terms of transfers in, with clubs like Aston Villa, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham buying more players than them over the last 20 years. 

3. The 2014/2015 season recorded the most transfers with over 1000 transfers, with only the 2011/2012 being the only season with over 1000 transfers. Generally, the early 2010s were the seasons with the most transfers with 4 seasons making the top 5. The fifth busiest season was the 2003/2004 season. The early 90s has the least transfers.

4. Unsurprisingly, the age group of most of players transferred was 21-25 as this is when players are usually 'hot' and deemed talented. Players aged 16-20 were also transferred more than players aged 26-30.

5. Forwards and defenders are the kind of players most sought after.
